622. Self-Divided Numbers
Easy
Self-divided numbers are numbers that are divisible by every digit in it.

For example, 24 is divisible because 24 % 2 = 0 and 24 % 4 = 0.

Obviously a self-divided number should not contain zero digit.

Given a range [low, high] (both low and high are inclusive), return all self-divided numbers in the range.

Example:

Input: low = 1; high = 15

Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15]
