577. Longest Tremble Subsequence
Easy
Given an integer array, a tremble subsequence is defined as a subsequence in which the difference between maximum value and minimum value is exactly 1. Return the length of the longest tremble subsequence of the given array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,7]

Output: 5

Explanation: The length of the longest tremble subsequence is [6,6,6,6,7] is 5.
