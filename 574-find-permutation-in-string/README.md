574. Find Permutation In String
Medium
Suppose there are two strings s1 and s2. If a permutation of s1 is substring of s2, return true, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "evol", s2 = "ilovegoogle"

Output: true

Explanation: s2 contains a substring "love" which is one of permutations of s1.

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "evol", s2 = "iloovegoogle"

Output: false

Explanation: s2 does not contain any substring equals to any permutation of s1.



Assumptions:

Both s1 and s2 are not null and only contain lower case letters.
Length of given strings are in range of [1, 1000].
