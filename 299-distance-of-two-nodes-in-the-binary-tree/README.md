Find distance between two given keys of a Binary Tree, no parent pointers are given. Distance between two nodes is the minimum number of edges to be traversed to reach one node from other.

Assumptions:

There are no duplicate keys in the binary tree.
The given two keys are guaranteed to be in the binary tree.
The given two keys are different.
Examples:

    1

   /  \

  2    3

 / \  /  \  

4   5 6   7

       \

         8

distance(4, 5) = 2

distance(4, 6) = 4
