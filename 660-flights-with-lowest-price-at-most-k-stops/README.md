Suppose there are m flights connecting n cities. Flight is represented by an int array int[] where the first element is departure city, the second element is destination city and the third element is the price.

Given a departure city src, a destination city dst, and most number of stops k, return the lowest price of flights can take you from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such a route, then return -1.

You can assume that there is no duplicated flights.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[0,2,1000], [1,2,200]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1

Output: 300

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[0,2,1000], [1,2,200]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0

Output: 1000
