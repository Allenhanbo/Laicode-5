Our company is going to distribute swags at the recruiting event. We will put the swags into square-shaped boxes. Each box has to be completely filled so that the swags wouldnâ€™t break during transportation. For example, a box can contain 1 swag, 4 swags, 9 swags, etc. (The boxes can be sufficiently large.)







However, if there are 10 swags, we have to put them into multiple boxes. For example, we could split them into four boxes:







Or maybe just two boxes are enough:







Given the number of swags, what is the minimum number of boxes to pack them up?



Example #1

Input: 4

Output: 1 (just one 2x2 box)



Example #2

Input: 10

Output: 2 (one 3x3 box and one 1x1 box)
