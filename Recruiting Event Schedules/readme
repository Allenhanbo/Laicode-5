Recruiting Event Schedules



Our company is organizing a series of university recruiting events. Each day, we host an event at one university, but sometimes we want to take a break for one day before moving on to the next university.



Given a sequence of universities, print all possible schedules of the recruiting events.



Input: a string of universities. Each university is represented as a single capital letter.

Output: all possible schedules. A lowercase letter “x” means we take a break.



Example

Input: String = “ABC”

Output:

ABC

ABxC
