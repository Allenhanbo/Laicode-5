310. Max Subarray Sum Difference
Medium
Given an array of integers. Find two disjoint contiguous subarrays in it such that the absolute value of the difference between the sums of two subarray is maximum.  Return the maximum difference.

Assumptions:

The given array is not null and has length of at least 2.
Examples:

Input: { 1, -3, 1, -4, 3, 4 }

Two subarrays: {-3, 1, -4 }, { 3, 4 }

Maximum difference = 13
